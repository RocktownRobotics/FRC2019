Main

    Probably does something useful. Don't mess with it.

OI

    This assigns what buttons do what things, and also assigns names to the various buttons and other inputs

    Still needs to have the actual keybindings emplaced.

Robot

    The basic skeleton that runs all the other things. Basically the metaclass to rule all the metaclasses

    Contains instances of all Robot subsystems

    Also chooses the Autonomous program to run, though this is not currently in place

RobotMap

    This assigns all the various things to all the various ports

    right now everything is on null port
