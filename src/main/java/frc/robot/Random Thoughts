    -A couple options for the HatchSucker vacuum... 
        1) we could just have a Suck command triggered by a WhileHeld
        2) We could have a Suck and StopSucking, controlled by a MetaSuck command group that would whenPressed
toggle between Suck and StopSucking, with each just interrupting the other... I mostly just want an excuse toggle
make MetaSuck a thing... and now it is.


    -MECHANICAL-- We'll need some kind of passive holder thing that keeps the preloaded Hatch in contact with the
HatchSucker while the HatchArm is retracted, as the HatchSucker is not going to be activated right at the start of
the match and we don't want our Hatch falling out onto the floor. This can just be a little nonmotorized arm that gets
shoved down when the HatchArm deploys and needs to be manually reset, we don't need it after we get control of the
HatchSucker systems. Alternatively it could be a little rail that the Hatch slides into when the HatchArm is retracted,
the details are irrelevant.
